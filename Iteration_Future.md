# Iteration 3 Time Estimates

>  V1: Week / Chapter 1 
### Available Ideal Work Days
- 4 weeks with 1 work day per team member
- 5 team members
- Total: 5 x 1 x 4 = 20 

### Iteration Summary
> V1: Week / Chapter 1
#### User Stories:
- [Reccuring Bookings](user_stories/recurring_bookings.md) (30) (1 Days)
- [Service Offerings](user_stories/service_offerings.md) (30) (4 Days)
- Total: N/A

#### Updated Velocity Calculation:
- Velocity calculation formula:
- V3 = E2 / A2
- V3 = Velocity for iteration 2
- E2 = Estimated user story days pre-velocity in iteration 2
- A2 = Actual days to complete iteration 2
- V3 = 16 / 17
- V3 = 0.94 (Likely highly unreliable due to cramming work in before end of trimester to focus on other subjects)

>V2: Week / Chapter 3
**Team Velocity:** 0.94 (Recommended velocity using the velocity calculation formula following a completed iteration)
#### User Stories (Adjusted for Velocity)
- ~[Reccuring Bookings](user_stories/recurring_bookings.md) (30) (1 Days)
- ~[Service Offerings](user_stories/service_offerings.md) (30) (4 Days)
