# User Registration and Profile Management

## Description  

>   V1: Week / Chapter 1
- As an individual cleaner, I want to create an account and set up my profile so that I can be discovered by potential clients.  

## Priority:  

>   V1: Week / Chapter 1 
- 10
- This feature **must be added before** many other features relating to user accounts can be implemented  

## Estimation:  

>   V1: Week / Chapter 1 
- 3 days 

>   V1: Week / Chapter 3
- Adjusted for Velocity: 4 days (3 / 0.7 = 4.2)
### + Planning Poker  

- Luke: 3  
- Zane: 3 
- Corey: 3  
- Dylan: 4
- Caleb: 4

Average: 3 days (3.4)  

### + Assumptions  

- We will need to store the cleaner's availability in association with their other profile details in the database.
- It will be straightforward to create user database entries classified by whether they are a cleaner or client. 

### + Dependencies

- None
