# Accepting and Managing Bookings for Cleaners

## Description  

>   V1: Week / Chapter 1
- As a cleaner, I want to receive and manage service requests, so I can accept jobs that fit my availability and workload. I should be able to see a list of customer bookings, and be able to accept or reject them

## Tasks
