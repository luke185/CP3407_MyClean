# Accepting and Managing Bookings for Cleaners

## Description  

>   V1: Week / Chapter 1
- As a cleaner, I want to receive and manage service requests, so I can accept jobs that fit my availability and workload. I should be able to see a list of customer bookings, and be able to accept or reject them

## Priority:  
>   V1: Week / Chapter 1 
- 20

## Estimation:  

>   V1: Week / Chapter 1
- 3 days

>   V1: Week / Chapter 3
- Adjusted for Velocity: 4 days (3 / 0.7 = 4.2)

### + Planning Poker  
  
- Luke: 4
- Zane: 4
- Corey: 4
- Dylan: 5
- Caleb: 5

Average: 4 days (4.4)

### + Assumptions  

- Assuming that bookings shouldn't just be automatically accepted when they are made.
- Assuming we can easily duplicate the client booking summary interface for providers

### + Dependencies

- Customers will need to be able to make bookings in order for cleaners to accept or reject them. 

## Tasks  
>   V1: Week / Chapter 3
1. Add interface and database logic to allow cleaners to toggle automatic acceptance of bookings (1 Day)
2. Add a booking summary to the provided dashboard that includes a bookings status (0.5 days)
3. Add buttons to accept or reject bookings if automatic acceptance is not toggled on (0.5 days)
4. Add a button to cancel a client booking that does not make the slots available again (1 day)
