### Available Ideal Work Days
- 4 weeks with 1 work day per team member
- 5 team members
- Total: 5 x 1 x 4 = 20

#### User Stories:

- [Display all company listings](user_stories/display_all_company_listings.md) (10) [4 days]

- [Company Listing Filters](user_stories/company_listing_filters.md) (10) (4 days) (This priority 10 now fits here. Secure Online Payment moved to Iteration 2 due to velocity) 
- Total: 19 Days

Note: After further research into tools (clearing up some assumptions) we repeated the planning poker process and our estimates increased.
