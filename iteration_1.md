# Iteration 1 Time Estimates

>  V1: Week / Chapter 1 
### Available Ideal Work Days
- 4 weeks with 1 work day per team member
- 5 team members
- Total: 5 x 1 x 4 = 20 

### Iteration Summary
> V1: Week / Chapter 1
#### User Stories:
- [User Registration](user_stories/user_registration_and_profile_management.md) (10) [3 days] 
- [Display all company listings](user_stories/display_all_company_listings.md) (10) [4 days]
- [Book a cleaning service](user_stories/book_a_cleaning_service.md) (10) [4 days]
- [Secure Online Payment](user_stories/secure_online_payments.md) (10) [4 days]
- Notifications for New Bookings (20) [1 days] {Squeeze this in as a 1 day task} (Split into 2 tasks and no longer fits in iteration 1)
- Total: 16 days

> [!WARNING]
> Note: Initially we had 4 group members and were working on a 16 day iteration.

>V2: Week / Chapter 3
**Team Velocity:** 0.7 (Recommended velocity for the first iteration of a new project)
#### User Stories (Adjusted for Velocity)
- [User Registration](user_stories/user_registration_and_profile_management.md) (10) (4 days)
- [Display all company listings](user_stories/display_all_company_listings.md) (10) (6 days)
- [Book a cleaning service](user_stories/book_a_cleaning_service.md) (10) (5 days)
- [Company Listing Filters](user_stories/company_listing_filters.md) (10) (4 days) {This priority 10 now fits here. Secure Online Payment moved to Iteration 2 as it is now too long} 
- Total: 20 Days

Note: After further research into tools (clearing up some assumptions) we repeated the planning poker process and our estimates increased.
