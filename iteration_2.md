# Iteration 2 Time Estimates

>  V1: Week / Chapter 1 
### Available Ideal Work Days
- 4 weeks with 1 work day per team member
- 5 team members
- Total: 5 x 1 x 4 = 20 

### Iteration Summary
> V1: Week / Chapter 1
#### User Stories:
- [Viewing and Managing Appointments for Clients](user_stories/viewing_and_managing_appointments_for_clients.md) (20) (4 Days)
- [Accepting and Manging Bookings for Cleaners](user_stories/accepting_and_managing_bookings_for_cleaners.md) (20) (4 Days)
- Cleaning Package Selection (30) (4 Days) (removed from iteration 2)
- [Reccuring Bookings](user_stories/recurring_bookings.md) (30) (1 Days)
- Service Offerings (30) (3 Days) (removed from iteration 2)
- Total: 16 Days

#### Updated Velocity Calculation:
- Velocity calculation formula:
- V2 = E2 / E1 * V1
- V2 = Velocity for iteration 2
- E2 = Estimated user story days pre-velocity in iteration 2
- E1 = Estimated user story days pre-velocity in iteration 1
- V1 = Velocity for iteration 1
- V2 = 16 / 16 * 0.7
- V2 = 0.7

> [!WARNING]
> Note: Initially we had 4 group members and were working on a 16 day iteration. We used a Figjam board to plan our iterations and later updated our Github (see Figjam screenshots)
> TODO: ADD FIGJAM SCREENSHOTS

>V2: Week / Chapter 3
**Team Velocity:** 0.7 (Recommended velocity using the velocity calculation formula following a completed iteration)
